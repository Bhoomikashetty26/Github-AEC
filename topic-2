Creating and Merging Branches
a. Create a new branch named "feature-branch". Switch to the "master" branch. Merge the "feature-branch" into "master".

git branch feature-branch
git checkout feature-branch
git add .
git commit -m "<message>"
git push origin feature-branch:main
b. Write the command to stash your changes switch branches and then apply the stashed changes.

git checkout new-branch
git stash
